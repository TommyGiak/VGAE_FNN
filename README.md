# VGAE-FNN for link prediction
Implementation of a VGAE (variational graph auto-encoder) connected to a FNN (feedforward neural network) for link prediction.
This work is inspired by the model presented in [this paper](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03646-8). Actually the first goal is to reproduce the results presented in the paper and then try to study the validity of the model with different types of datasets.
Up to now there's a massive lack of documentation that will be added soon, hopefully.
